FIZZBUZZ MVC WEB APPLICATION

This application is a variation developed based on the coding exercise proposed by the following source: "Using FizzBuzz to Find Developers who Grok Coding" http://tickletux.wordpress.com/2007/01/24/using-fizzbuzz-to-find-developers-who-grok-coding/

The application has been developed in C# coding language and .NET framework on MVS 2019.

Application functionality:

1.	Basic Fizz-Buzz:
	a.	User can enter a positive integer.
	b.	Prints out, in a vertical list, all of the values between 1 and the entered value.
	c.	Where the number is divisible by 3, prints 'fizz'.
	d.	Where the number is divisible by 5, prints 'buzz'
	e.	Where the number is divisible by 3 AND 5, prints 'fizz buzz’.
2.	Contains validation to ensure the entered value is an integer between 1 and 1000.
3.	Styling is added so 'fizz' is printed in blue, and 'buzz' in green.
4.	Logic is amended so that if today is Wednesday, the words 'wizz' and ‘wuzz' are substituted for 'fizz' and 'buzz’.
5.	Program is amended so only 20 values are displayed at a time. 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons are implemented to display the remaining values. 

6.	TO DO (work in progress) = A RESTful web service is required  to record the user entered values.
	a.	Design and document this web service.
	b.	Implement it as a mock or stub in your code.
